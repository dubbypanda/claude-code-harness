# Claude Code Harness V2 Spec

Status: draft SSOT for Phase 72 through Phase 74
Last updated: 2026-05-22

This file is the root product contract for Claude Code Harness V2.
Plans.md is the task ledger. `spec.md` is the product contract.
`spec.md` says what must stay true.

## Purpose

V2 makes Harness a faster operator workflow without weakening evidence.

The goal is to reduce human planning and verification load by letting Harness:

- classify work before execution,
- lock the correct specification before implementation,
- require TDD evidence when behavior changes,
- route review depth by risk,
- create PR-ready evidence packs,
- preserve release-grade checks for public artifacts.
- onboard users through the tool they already use, while only claiming support
  that has adapter evidence.
- keep repo-health gates such as formatting, linting, release preflight, and
  host runtime smoke aligned with the support tier being claimed.

## Users And Workflows

Primary user:

- An operator who prefers AI to prepare the plan, implementation, comparison,
  and verification evidence, while the operator makes the final judgment.

Core workflows:

- Plan from an ambiguous request into a spec-backed `Plans.md` task contract.
- Execute `Plans.md` tasks with lane-aware effort and TDD gates.
- Review implementation against `spec.md`, `Plans.md`, tests, and evidence.
- Produce PR closeout artifacts without silently pushing or merging.
- Release only after version, tag, GitHub Release, CI, and public-surface checks.
- Strengthen lint/format and host-runtime smoke without confusing static
  compatibility with public support.

## SSOT Layers

The source-of-truth order is:

1. `spec.md`: root product contract for this repository.
2. Sub-specs for specialized domains:
   - `docs/architecture/hokage-core.md` for reusable core architecture.
   - `go/SPEC.md` for Go runtime behavior.
   - Other clearly named docs under `docs/` for scoped contracts.
3. `Plans.md`: task ledger, dependencies, DoD, status, and evidence trail.
4. Runtime evidence: tests, review artifacts, PR body, CI, release output.

`Plans.md` must not replace `spec.md`. A task can be complete only if its DoD
passes and the result does not contradict the applicable spec.

## Hokage Core And Host Adapter Boundary

Hokage Core defines workflow contracts. Host adapters translate those contracts
into a specific agent runtime.

Core may define:

- workflow intent,
- user-facing triggers,
- inputs and outputs,
- required evidence,
- acceptance criteria,
- review and completion rules,
- generic capability requirements.

Core must not depend directly on Claude hook names, Claude-only tools,
Codex-only tools, OpenCode config shape, Cursor rule shape, GitHub Copilot CLI
command shape, Antigravity CLI command shape, or marketplace packaging details.

Adapters own the host-specific mechanics:

| Adapter | Owns | Must Not Claim |
|---------|------|----------------|
| Claude Code | Claude plugin manifest, hooks, settings, output styles, runtime guardrails | That non-Claude hosts have identical hook enforcement |
| Codex CLI / Codex app | Codex skills, `AGENTS.md` guidance, companion wrapper, local plugin marketplace path, post-exec quality gates | That Codex can always stop unsafe actions before execution |
| OpenCode | native skill packaging, OpenCode config, `AGENTS.md` guidance, setup docs, package validation, bootstrap injection when verified | That mirror sync alone proves runtime parity |
| Cursor | rules/adapter investigation, install candidate docs, smoke proof when available | Support before bootstrap and workflow smoke pass |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | CLI command investigation, tool mapping candidate, smoke proof when available | Support based only on Superpowers evidence |
| Antigravity CLI | CLI/rules investigation, manual profile candidate if no plugin contract exists | Adapter support without an official or verified bootstrap route |

An adapter manifest or support document may be added only when setup, docs
generation, release preflight, or an adapter smoke test consumes it in the same
phase.

## Support Tiers And Host Claims

Public support wording must use support tiers.

| Tier | Meaning | Claim Allowed |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `supported` | Install/update path, bootstrap proof, skill loading, one workflow smoke, compatibility checks, and release/preflight gate all pass. | Public support claim for the verified host and version range. |
| `internal-compatible` | Repo mirror, setup docs, static validation, or local tooling exists, but runtime proof is incomplete. | Internal compatibility or experimental wording only. |
| `candidate` | Current official docs and local evidence suggest a viable adapter path, but no complete smoke proof exists. | Research or spike wording only. |
| `future/unsupported` | No verified adapter path or no current proof. | No setup docs, README support claim, or release support claim. |

Current default stance:

| Host | Default Tier | Reason |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Claude Code | `supported` for Claude-first Harness | Primary product surface and distribution payload. |
| Codex CLI | `internal-compatible` until direct plugin install and companion smoke are verified together | Existing Codex mirror and setup path exist; direct plugin path must be proven separately. |
| Codex app | `candidate` under the Codex adapter | App behavior must be verified separately from CLI help output. |
| OpenCode | `internal-compatible` until runtime bootstrap smoke passes | Existing mirror/setup validation exists; runtime parity is not yet proven. |
| Cursor | `candidate` | Superpowers has a useful reference shape, but Harness has no verified adapter gate yet. |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `candidate` | Current CLI docs must be verified and Harness-specific bootstrap proof is missing. |
| Antigravity CLI | `future/unsupported` until an official/verified adapter route exists | No local Harness or Superpowers adapter evidence has been observed. |

Phase 73.1.2 freezes this stance from
`docs/research/superpowers-cherrypick.md`. These tiers are authoritative until
the relevant host-specific setup route, bootstrap proof, workflow smoke, and
release/preflight gate all pass in the same claim path.

README, onboarding, and release wording must not imply that `candidate` or
`future/unsupported` hosts are supported. Candidate hosts may appear only as
research, spike, or adapter-candidate work. `future/unsupported` hosts may
appear only as future scope, unsupported scope, or unknown/unobserved research.

If a host is not observed in the current runtime, Harness must say `unknown` or
`not observed`, not `unsupported`, unless the relevant source of truth was
checked.

## Onboarding Contract

Onboarding is not complete when files are copied. It is complete when the first
useful session can be verified.

New-user onboarding must provide:

- a tool-first front door: "which agent are you using now?",
- an install or setup route for that host,
- the first command or first prompt to try,
- what successful bootstrap looks like,
- a verification command or smoke transcript,
- the support tier and known asymmetries.

Existing-user migration must provide:

- a before-state inventory,
- backup locations outside skill scan paths,
- stale plugin/cache/residue detection,
- duplicate local skill detection,
- harness-mem state handling that never deletes memory by default,
- rollback instructions that avoid destructive cleanup unless explicitly
  confirmed.

Superpowers is the reference pattern for multi-host onboarding: common skills,
thin host adapters, bootstrap guidance, skill-trigger tests, and explicit host
tool mapping. Harness may cherry-pick that pattern, but every copied idea must
be translated into Harness lanes, Plans.md tasks, TDD/review gates, and support
tier evidence.

## New Session Bootstrap Rule

A new agent session must be able to start from one task id without re-inventing
the plan.

Each startable task must make these visible:

- source spec path,
- current task id,
- first action,
- expected evidence artifact,
- blocked conditions,
- stop or handoff condition.

If a phase is broad, the first task must be research/evidence or plan-freeze.
Implementation must not begin until the evidence artifact narrows the files,
tests, smoke commands, and claim boundaries for the next tasks.

## Lane Taxonomy

Harness V2 uses lanes as task metadata, not as separate primary skills.

| Lane | Use When | Required Closeout |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| `[lane:fast]` | Low-risk local docs, narrow cleanup, small isolated fixes | focused checks, concise evidence pack, no full review by default |
| `[lane:gate]` | Skill, workflow, guardrail, mirror, CI, spec, or shared behavior changes | spec alignment, TDD when required, major-only or full review, re-review until clean |
| `[lane:release]` | Public artifact, version, tag, GitHub Release, CI, binary/package surface | release preflight, version sync, tags, GitHub Release, CI/latest verification |

Fast lane is not a bypass. It still needs a scope, DoD, focused verification,
and an explicit residual-risk statement.

## Stage Gate Flow

Every non-trivial V2 plan follows this path:

1. Research and verification
   - Read current repo state, relevant docs, `Plans.md`, memory, and available
     runtime evidence.
   - Treat failed searches, unavailable APIs, missing fixtures, and unseen data
     as `unknown`.
2. Implementation plan freeze
   - Record lane, scope, DoD, dependencies, TDD tag, risk gates, and evidence
     expectations in `Plans.md`.
3. Implementation with TDD
   - For `[tdd:required]`, create or update a failing test first and keep red
     evidence via red-log or literal failing output.
   - Use `[tdd:skip:<reason>]` only when the reason is explicit and reviewable.
4. Review
   - `harness-review` stays read-only by default.
   - `APPROVE` means the quality gate passed. It does not mean commit, push,
     PR, merge, or release may happen automatically.
5. PR closeout
   - PR artifacts include base/head refs, spec path, lane, stage, tests, review
     result, accepted/rejected findings, residual risk, and warnings handled.
   - Push and PR creation are external side effects and require an explicit
     flag or confirmation gate.
6. Release closeout
   - Release lane is complete only after version surfaces, tags, GitHub Release,
     CI, and public artifact checks are verified.

## Unknown Data Contract

Harness V2 must distinguish unobserved data from absent data.

Required rule:

```text
not_observed != absent
```

If an agent cannot see a file, API response, memory record, CI run, GitHub
object, fixture, or runtime output, it must report `unknown`, `unavailable`, or
`not observed`. It must not claim the data does not exist unless it has checked
the relevant source of truth.

Examples:

- Search timed out: `unknown`, not `no results exist`.
- Fixture was not loaded: `not observed`, not `fixture missing`.
- harness-mem was unavailable: `memory unavailable`, not `no memory`.
- Local tests passed: `local checks passed`, not `PR/release ready`.

## Review Contract

`harness-review` checks:

- spec alignment,
- `Plans.md` scope and DoD,
- TDD evidence when required,
- regression risk,
- accepted and rejected findings,
- unknown data handling,
- evidence pack completeness.

Critical or major findings produce `REQUEST_CHANGES`.
Minor or recommendation-only findings can still produce `APPROVE` when the
acceptance bar is met.

## PR And Release Boundary

PR closeout belongs to `harness-work`, not `harness-review`.

Release belongs to `harness-release`, not PR closeout.

Do not merge these stages:

- PR ready means the change has a reviewable branch and evidence pack.
- Release ready means the public release path has passed preflight and the
  release artifacts are verified.

## Memory Contract

When a planning or design decision is made, Harness should record why it was
chosen, not only what changed.

Preferred memory targets:

- `harness-mem` project-scoped ingest/search when available.
- `.claude/memory/decisions.md` and `.claude/memory/patterns.md` when present.
- `Plans.md` and spec documents as local, reviewable SSOTs.

If harness-mem is unavailable, the agent must say so and keep the local SSOT
updated instead of pretending memory was written.

## Non-Goals

V2 does not:

- replace `Plans.md` with `spec.md`,
- split Fast/Gate/Release into three new primary skills,
- make every task a heavy Gate lane task,
- replace `cc:TODO`, `cc:WIP`, or `cc:完了` markers,
- let review auto-commit, push, PR, merge, or release,
- treat local green checks as PR-ready or release-ready by themselves,
- weaken release verification to save time.
- claim Cursor, GitHub Copilot CLI, Antigravity CLI, or generic cross-host
  support before support-tier evidence exists.
- copy Superpowers slogans or trigger rules when they conflict with Harness
  verbs, lanes, or guardrails.

## Open Decisions

- Exact PR closeout command shape: `harness-work --pr` vs
  `scripts/harness-pr-closeout.sh`.
- Final machine-readable evidence schema for PR bodies and closeout artifacts.
- Whether `.claude/memory/decisions.md` and `.claude/memory/patterns.md` should
  be created in this repository or remain optional memory surfaces.
- Whether Codex direct plugin installation becomes the default Codex path or
  stays secondary to `scripts/setup-codex.sh --user`.
- Which current host docs and smoke tests are sufficient to promote Cursor,
  GitHub Copilot CLI, or Antigravity CLI from `candidate` /
  `future/unsupported`.
